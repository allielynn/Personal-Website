## Approach:
- Conducted an in-depth analysis of NBA player salaries using statistical modeling.
- Verified the assumptions of linear regression, including constant variance, linearity, and normality, using diagnostic plots.
- Transformed the salary variable through an inverse response method to better satisfy model assumptions.
- Performed variable selection and model evaluation using AIC, AICc, and BIC, ensuring an optimal balance between model complexity and performance.

## Findings:
- Performance metrics such as points per game, age, and total rebounds were significant predictors of salary.
- Addressing outliers and ensuring model assumptions were met improved predictive performance.
- While linear regression provided meaningful salary insights, the relationship between performance and salary is influenced by factors beyond in-game statistics, such as contract negotiations and marketability.
