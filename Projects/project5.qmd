## Approach:
- Collaborated with a team as part of an experimental design course at UCLA to analyze caffeineâ€™s effects on attention scores using a simulated island environment.
- Designed a two-way randomized block experiment to control for variability and ensure reliable data collection.
- Administered varying caffeine doses followed by attention tests to measure cognitive performance.
- Applied linear regression modeling in R to analyze the effects of caffeine on attention scores.

## Findings:
- Verified key assumptions of linear regression, including constant variance, linearity, and normality, by reviewing diagnostic plots.
 Used interaction plots to examine combined effects of predictor variables and box plots to visualize distribution and variance in attention scores across different caffeine intake levels.
- Provided insights into how caffeine consumption influences focus and cognitive performance, contributing to research on behavioral and cognitive effects of stimulants.
