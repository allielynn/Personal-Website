As part of an experimental design course at UCLA, I collaborated with a team to conduct an in-depth analysis of caffeine’s effects on attention scores using a simulated island environment. The project used a two-way randomized block design to control for variability and ensure reliable data collection. We aimed to identify the effect of various caffeine levels on attention scores by administering doses followed by an attention test. After gathering data through a carefully structured experimental design, which included randomization, consistent caffeine dosing, and control groups, we applied linear regression modeling techniques in R to analyze the results. A crucial part of our analysis involved verifying the assumptions of linear regression—constant variance, linearity, and normality—by reviewing the diagnostic plots. We used interaction plots to explore relationships between predictor variables and their combined effects on attention scores, and box plots to visualize the distribution and variance in attention across different levels of caffeine intake. Our results provided a nuanced understanding of how caffeine consumption affects attention, offering insights that could even influence personal decisions regarding caffeine consumption and its impact on focus and cognitive performance.
