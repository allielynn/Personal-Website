## Approach:

-   Retrieved Lana Del Rey's album and track data using Spotify's API, extracting falbums, tracks, and popularity ratings.
-   Processed and cleaned the data using pandas in Python, structuring it for analysis.
-   Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine trends across albums and tracks.

## Findings:

-   Identified Born to Die as the most popular album, aligning with the top remix tracks, which also originated from Born to Die.
-   Visualized key track metrics, comparing popularity ratings across all albums.
