Using historical season data, this project aimed to predict NBA game results for the 2023-2024 season through feature engineering and machine learning models employed in Python.

## Approach:
- Processed data from 2,460 NBA games, incorporating features such as team performance metrics, game statistics, and match history.
- Applied extensive feature engineering, introducing advanced metrics like True Shooting Percentage, Effective Field Goal Percentage, ELO ratings, rolling averages, win streaks, and variance stability measures.
- Utilized exponential decay weighting to emphasize recent games over older performances.
- Employed Linear SVC for feature selection.
- Evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, LDA, and QDA.

## Findings:
- Gradient Boosting and Random Forest emerged as the top models, achieving a prediction accuracy of 93.87%.
- ELO ratings and opponent-dependent statistics were key features for game prediction, emphasizing the interactive nature of basketball matchups.
- Non-linear models (Gradient Boosting and Random Forest) outperformed linear classifiers, demonstrating the complex relationships in game outcomes.
- Game outcome prediction significantly benefits from engineered features rather than raw statistics alone.
