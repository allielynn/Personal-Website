## Experience

Ryan, LLC \| Data Strategy Intern \| June 2024 - Aug 2024

In my role as a Data Strategy Intern at Ryan, I collaborated closely with technology leaders to streamline data pipelines and analysis processes through automation. I crafted SQL queries for database manipulation and cleaning, working primarily in Databricks. Additionally, I developed Python scripts for large-scale data analysis, and I practiced data visualization techniques working with tools such as Tableau and Power BI. I also employed large language models to optimize data solutions and enhance data processing capabilities. I gained knowledge on machine learning techniques using PyTorch, applying neural network structures while drawing on my background of statistical modeling. My work was organized using Agile methodologies, including sprint planning with Azure DevOps, to ensure efficient project execution and continuous improvement. This experience significantly improved my ability to work efficiently in iterative cycles, adapt to changing project requirements, and contribute effectively to team goals.

Unlimited Tutoring \| Calculus Tutor \| April 2023 - June 2024

In my role as a Mathematics Tutor, I conducted remote tutoring sessions for both high school and college mathematics courses. Leveraging my extensive mathematics knowledge and strong communication skills, I provided one-on-one tutoring, specializing in Calculus, Statistics, and other advanced mathematics subjects. This role has significantly improved my ability to present complex concepts in an easy-to-understand manner, a skill essential for a data scientist. This experience has also enhanced my communication skills, allowing me to communicate insights clearly and effectively.
