    "section": "",
    "text": "GitHub Repo\n\nThis project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning models to analyze key clinical predictors. By applying Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and validating its assumptions, we found that heart disease risk follows a primarily linear relationship with factors like ejection fraction, high blood pressure, and time. To enhance interpretability, we used LASSO regression for feature selection, simplifying the model while maintaining predictive accuracy. Comparisons with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting confirmed that complex, non-linear models did not improve performance, reinforcing the effectiveness of a linear approach. These findings highlight the potential for interpretable, data-driven models to assist in clinical risk assessment and patient stratification for heart disease."

    "title": "Predicting NBA Game Outcomes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "GitHub Repo\n\nThis project, conducted in collaboration with other UCLA students as part of our Data Mining course, aimed to predict NBA game outcomes using historical data from the 2023-2024 season, which included 2,460 entries with features such as team performance metrics, game statistics, and match outcomes. Through extensive feature engineering, advanced metrics like True Shooting Percentage, Effective Field Goal Percentage, and ELO ratings were introduced, alongside rolling averages, win streaks, matchup history, and stability (variance in team metrics over recent games). An exponential decay weighting system was applied to emphasize recent games. Various machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, SVC, LDA, and QDA, were evaluated. Gradient Boosting and Random Forest emerged as the most effective, achieving a prediction accuracy of 93.87% by capturing complex linear and non-linear patterns in the data. Key features such as team and opponent ELO ratings and historical matchup performance highlighted the interactive and opponent-dependent nature of game outcomes. This project showcased the power of advanced modeling and feature engineering in sports analytics."

    "title": "NBA Salary Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "GitHub Repo\n\nAs part of a linear regression course at UCLA, I collaborated with a team of peers to conduct an in-depth analysis of NBA player salaries, aiming to identify significant predictors influencing salary variations. Employing linear modeling techniques in R, we examined potential predictors, assessing their statistical significance. A crucial component of our analysis involved verifying the assumptions of linear regression (constant variance, linearity, and normality) by evaluating the diagnostic plots. To better satisfy these assumptions, we applied a transformation to the target variable, improving the model assumptions. After addressing outliers and ensuring the model met regression assumptions, we selected the optimal model based on AIC, AICc, and BIC, effectively managing multicollinearity. Our model provided valuable insights into the factors influencing NBA player salaries, allowing us to explore salary fluctuations and the nuances of significant predictor variables. By incorporating research on the basketball industry, we were able to interpret our findings more effectively, offering a comprehensive, data-driven perspective on the determinants of NBA player salaries."
