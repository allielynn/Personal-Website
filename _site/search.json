    "section": "",
    "text": "GitHub Repo\n\nThis project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning models to analyze key clinical predictors. By applying Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and validating its assumptions, we found that heart disease risk follows a primarily linear relationship with factors like ejection fraction, high blood pressure, and time. To enhance interpretability, we used LASSO regression for feature selection, simplifying the model while maintaining predictive accuracy. Comparisons with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting confirmed that complex, non-linear models did not improve performance, reinforcing the effectiveness of a linear approach. These findings highlight the potential for interpretable, data-driven models to assist in clinical risk assessment and patient stratification for heart disease."

    "section": "",
    "text": "GitHub Repo\n\nThis project, conducted in collaboration with other UCLA students as part of our Data Mining course, aimed to predict NBA game outcomes using historical data from the 2023-2024 season, which included 2,460 entries with features such as team performance metrics, game statistics, and match outcomes. Through extensive feature engineering, advanced metrics like True Shooting Percentage, Effective Field Goal Percentage, and ELO ratings were introduced, alongside rolling averages, win streaks, matchup history, and stability (variance in team metrics over recent games). An exponential decay weighting system was applied to emphasize recent games. Various machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, SVC, LDA, and QDA, were evaluated. Gradient Boosting and Random Forest emerged as the most effective, achieving a prediction accuracy of 93.87% by capturing complex linear and non-linear patterns in the data. Key features such as team and opponent ELO ratings and historical matchup performance highlighted the interactive and opponent-dependent nature of game outcomes. This project showcased the power of advanced modeling and feature engineering in sports analytics."

I am drawing from the Spotify API and for context as to how the popularity scores are calculated I have included the description of the popularity score calculation below.\n“The Spotify popularity score is a numerical representation of how well a track is performing on the platform. It ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher popularity. This score influences the track’s visibility on Spotify, including its likelihood of being featured on algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar.\nSpotify’s popularity score is determined by a variety of factors:\nStreams: The number of times a track is streamed. Recent Activity: More weight is given to recent streams. Engagement: Includes likes, shares, saves, and playlist additions. Listener Behavior: How long listeners play the track and if they skip it. User Interactions: Actions such as follows, comments, and social shares.”"

    "text": "GitHub Repo\n\nAs part of an experimental design course at UCLA, I collaborated with a team to conduct an in-depth analysis of caffeine’s effects on attention scores using a simulated island environment. The project used a two-way randomized block design to control for variability and ensure reliable data collection. We aimed to identify the effect of various caffeine levels on attention scores by administering doses followed by an attention test. After gathering data through a carefully structured experimental design, which included randomization, consistent caffeine dosing, and control groups, we applied linear regression modeling techniques in R to analyze the results. A crucial part of our analysis involved verifying the assumptions of linear regression—constant variance, linearity, and normality—by reviewing the diagnostic plots. We used interaction plots to explore relationships between predictor variables and their combined effects on attention scores, and box plots to visualize the distribution and variance in attention across different levels of caffeine intake. Our results provided a nuanced understanding of how caffeine consumption affects attention, offering insights that could even influence personal decisions regarding caffeine consumption and its impact on focus and cognitive performance."

    "text": "GitHub Repo\n\nAs part of a linear regression course at UCLA, I collaborated with a team of peers to conduct an in-depth analysis of NBA player salaries, aiming to identify significant predictors influencing salary variations. Employing linear modeling techniques in R, we examined potential predictors, assessing their statistical significance. A crucial component of our analysis involved verifying the assumptions of linear regression (constant variance, linearity, and normality) by evaluating the diagnostic plots. To better satisfy these assumptions, we applied a transformation to the target variable, improving the model assumptions. After addressing outliers and ensuring the model met regression assumptions, we selected the optimal model based on AIC, AICc, and BIC, effectively managing multicollinearity. Our model provided valuable insights into the factors influencing NBA player salaries, allowing us to explore salary fluctuations and the nuances of significant predictor variables. By incorporating research on the basketball industry, we were able to interpret our findings more effectively, offering a comprehensive, data-driven perspective on the determinants of NBA player salaries."
